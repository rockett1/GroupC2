The project is based on the idea of a Virtual Robot Bairgain Hunter.

Our 'game'takes the input from a user: a timer, a sort in and sort by criteria, and the characteristics for the items to be found.
It uses A* pathfinding algorithm to search for the randomly spawn items, avoiding the randomly spawn obstacles.
After the search is done, the items are sorted and displayed.

This system uses the pygame module
